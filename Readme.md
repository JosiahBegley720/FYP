Final Year Project
Title: AI Image Generation with Diffusion Model

CID: 01846829

Description:
This is my implementation of the DDPM using fixed variance and cosine scheduling and shows the model trained with 25 epochs and all other hyperparameters set. My implementation follows LabML DDPM and uses LabML libraries to run and manage my experiments for training and evaluating my model. This implementation can be run in colab and requires connection to Google Drive for loading and saving although this can be modified to run locally.
